Type casting // Converting one data type to another type 
1) Explicit/narrowng/manual
when we go from bigger to smaller 
 2) Implicit/widening/Automatic 
when we go from a smaller to larger data type 

1) byte (8) 2) short (16) char (16) 3) int(32) 4) long (64) 5) float (32)
5) float(32)

int box = 1000;
byte box2=(byte) box;

short box1=250;
int box2=box1;

Is statements:
  if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decisions based on
   some condition and provided data.
   if condition
   if else condition
   if else if condition
   nested if else condition
   
why we need to execute if else condition?
  when we are solving real life problems 
  like testing a web site our program needs to make a lot of decsions
  
What is the syntax of if else condition 
if condition 

boolean rich=true; //ifDemo project
    if(rich) {
    //syntax(condition) {
    System.out.println("lets buy house");
