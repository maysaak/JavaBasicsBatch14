Type Casting (primitive data types):
     Type casting is converting one data type to another one. 
     For example we can convert a short to byte a long to float one. 
     There are two main types implicit/withening/automatic and explicit/narrow/Manual 
Implicit/widening/automatic
     type casting:
     When java converts the data type, because there is no data loss in this Conversion 
     
     
     What is the syntax for type casting?

     If else conditions 
        If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data. 
     Why we should learn about if else?
         Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a web site our 
         programs need to make a lot of decisions.
         If (the given username and password matches)
         {go to home page} ELSE {give a user a warning}
     What is the syntax for If else conditions
          boolean isHungry = true;
          
     if (isHungry) {
     System.out.prinln("Please eat Something")
     }else{
     System.out.println("Lets build some java programs")
     }
